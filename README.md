# dotnet-todo-app

A simple todo app, including login and registration, for visitors who want to create and consume todo lists. There's also a messageboard for people who want to simply say hello(no registration needed for leaving a message).


## roadmap
- Frontend is mostly finished  - I just have to connect it to the backend via axios and style it a bit more.
  -   Fronted: vitesse starter template(visit link to see features), composition api (script setup), TS, Axios and Pinia. 
    -   https://github.com/antfu/vitesse
- Backend is currently being written 
  - C# + Postgress + Dapper.
- Once The frontend and backend are hooked up, I'll put the app in Docker containers and deploy it on Heroku.
