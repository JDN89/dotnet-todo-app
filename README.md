# Chore:
 - Remove **Carter** and user other  method to register apiEndpoints and services => Carter is slowing down minimal api, because it's trying to do the same thing -> redundant.
- create Database folder:
   - DbConnectionFactory.cs  (look at example Nick for inspiration) 
   - DatabaseInitializer.cs  (look at example Nick for inspiration)


# Description

This project is inspired by Google keep and is not meant to be used as a real todo list app.
I implemented the Vertical Slice Architecture: grouping everything related to a single action (business logic, data access, domain transfer objects,...) into one place. Each feature covers a vertical slice of the application. I think this architecture goes well in combination with the minimal Api.
