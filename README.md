# Chore:
Remove **Carter** and user other  method to register apiEndpoints and services => Carter is slowing down minimal api, because it's trying to do the same thing -> redundant.


# Description

This project is inspired by Google keep and is not meant to be used as a real todo list app.

DEMO: https://dotnet-vue-todo-app.herokuapp.com/
PWA Hosted on Heroku hobby dev, so the application will take a few seconds to load completely.

 - Frontend:
    - Vue 3 Composition API 
    - Pinia: Vue Store 
    - Windi CSS 
    - Typescript 
 - Backend:
    -  ASP.NET Core minimal web API 
    - PostgreSQL
    - Dapper: objectâ€“relational mapping 

## Usage
On the Homepage you can leave a message and say hello.

Register with a fake email and login in order to create, modify and delete your personal todo lists.
